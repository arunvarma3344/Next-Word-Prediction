fishy true mahi filet delicious eaten mahi many restaurants caribbean tell took box baked not mahi parts extremely fishy not mahi taste texture seemed mahi fish taste wise absolutely not would not buy received first ever omaha steaks order turned biggest disappointment far everything included order reasons image deceptive stuffed sole looks nothing like picture typical marketing stuff expected degree not really stuffed scallops crab meat stuffing basically clumps flavored bread something little crab scallops ingredients used ingredient stuffed fillets listed website ingredients sole fillets water partially hydrogenated soybean oil means traces trans fats absolutely ridiculous find ingredient gourmet food price period let alone see listed used ingredient buy organic stuffed fillets trader joes whole foods far less not worry crap ingredients renders healthy concept eating fish pretty much useless said ate tasted fine deal breaker traces trans fat not care things like make fine addition omaha steaks order taste wise tasted pretty good used lot lemon mine not overly buttery lemon probably minimized overly buttery taste compained made hydrogenated oils surprised omaha uses pretty much quality ingredients products sampled far except definitely not expecting see traces trans fats fish product not even bother check afterwards everything tried os not even come across high fructose corn syrup huge plus neither hfcs partially hydrogenated oils even found stuffed baked potatoes huge surprise stuffed potatoes usually full ingredients make delicious baked potato full sour cream bacon cheese without partially hydrogenated oils surely os capable stuffed soles put crab meat scallops already product perfect calorie carb fat protein wise using cheap ingredients like hydrogenated oils unacceptable gourmet food imo received flyer mail assortment foods beef pork really awful stuffed sole crab scallops well like dummy bought deal perhaps truth omaha steaks sole stuffed scallops crab really shread sole stuffed paste hesitant describe not good eat package arrived selected two filets mignon two sole stuffed scallops crab four potatoes au gratin potatoes edible beef tenderloin thin grill grilled anyway awful already commented sole still angry hours later color stupid not sit well read information omaha steaks sent us conformed suspicion no people state grade beef sell quality sole stuffed scallops crab perhaps compatable cheap diner interstate well hungry cheap thought might good interesting ok made mistakes long road trip buy kind nasty food serve home not think wife first decided try omaha steaks not know perhaps bored not even consider came package besides steaks first arrived honestly interested package dry ice measly bits beef little marbling looked petri dish grown also cooler small pork chops white hotdogs mini beef slider patties potato nuggets two big balls butter little plastic bags upon closer inspections actually read box discovered actually seafood inside butter months later decided try one not know perhaps bored wife however not interested experimenting turns instance almost always case right placing butter ball pan required tbsp water placing oven waited minimum thirty minutes peeked oven find looked like steamed piece sole sitting puddle watered butter protruding one end looked like pre chewed fish stick slime growing decided give couple minutes safe side checking every two minutes left oven full forty minutes stated maximum time instructions reluctantly pulled sole stuffed something oven considered hey maybe taste better looks first bite took stuffing smooshing one end sole sure enough pre chewed fish sticks texture slime powering flavor flour water yep paste immediately abandoned stuffing attempted eat sole others stated flavor mild nothing alright texture rubbery baked butter slime getting table statement came mind least someone not like crashes dinner party something feed honestly better buying fish sticks local grocer least not pre chewed not good sorely disappointed fish rubbery stuffing gummy garlicky plain bad not order ever furtherwhere shrimp omaha steak products years stuffed sole crab shrimp nice convenient awful not worth tasting could taste garlic buttery outside alittle rubbery left terrible overwhelming taste not even ask replacement omaha not good anyway finally decided order package deal knowing could get stuffed sole scallops crabmeat steaks well various things tried steaks first disappointed size say way properly portioned usually get quite thin okay best definitely not worth money next tried potatoes au gratin liked different sliced stuff casserole dish remember kid never liked potato balls looked really good fell short expecting expectations not high one deals first bite pretty good goes hill time done first one not care eat second one seemed like processed frozen food rather gourmet type item always thought ohama steaks figured price everything would high end steakhouse
